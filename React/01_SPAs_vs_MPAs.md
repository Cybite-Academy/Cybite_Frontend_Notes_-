Here‚Äôs a simple comparison of **SPAs (Single Page Applications)** vs **MPAs (Multi Page Applications)**:

---

### üîÑ **Basic Concept**

| **Aspect**          | **SPA (Single Page Application)**                                     | **MPA (Multi Page Application)**                                |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Page Loading**    | Loads one HTML page and updates content dynamically using JavaScript. | Loads a new HTML page from the server every time you navigate.  |
| **Navigation**      | Feels fast‚Äîno full page reloads.                                      | Each click leads to a full page reload.                         |
| **User Experience** | Smooth, app-like feel.                                                | Can feel slower and more traditional.                           |
| **URL Handling**    | Often uses JavaScript routing (e.g., React Router).                   | Each page has its own unique URL and is served from the server. |

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Technical Differences**

| **Feature**             | **SPA**                                                                                  | **MPA**                                                              |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend Frameworks** | Typically built with React, Angular, Vue.                                                | Often built using server-side tech like PHP, Django, Rails, ASP.NET. |
| **Data Handling**       | Loads data via APIs (usually REST or GraphQL).                                           | Loads data along with the page from the server.                      |
| **Initial Load Time**   | Slower (loads everything upfront).                                                       | Faster (loads only the needed page).                                 |
| **SEO**                 | More challenging (content is loaded via JS). Needs extra setup like SSR or prerendering. | Easier‚Äîsearch engines can crawl each page easily.                    |

### ‚úÖ **When to Use**

| **Use SPA If...**                                                    | **Use MPA If...**                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| You want a dynamic, fast, app-like experience (e.g., Gmail, Trello). | You have a content-heavy site with many static pages (e.g., blogs, news sites). |
| You‚Äôre building a dashboard or tool with lots of user interaction.   | You care about simple SEO and want straightforward page routing.                |
| You need to work mostly with APIs and dynamic data updates.          | Your app is primarily server-rendered or content-driven.                        |
