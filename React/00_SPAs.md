### What is a **SPA (Single Page Application)** in simple terms?

A **Single Page Application (SPA)** is a type of website or web app that loads just **one web page** at the start, and **updates the content dynamically** without refreshing the entire page every time you click a link or button.

Imagine you're using a website like Gmail or Twitter. When you click around, it feels fast because it's not reloading the whole page—just parts of it change. That’s a SPA.

### How SPAs Work (Simple Breakdown):

* Loads **one HTML page** when you first visit.
* Uses **JavaScript (often with frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular)** to change what you see on the page without needing to ask the server for a full new page.
* Only **sends and receives small bits of data (like JSON)** from the server when needed.
