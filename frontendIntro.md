**Frontend Development in a Nutshell (Simple Terms)**

Frontend development is all about **what users see and interact with** on a website or app. It‚Äôs like the **face** of a website ‚Äî the layout, buttons, colors, fonts, animations, and how things behave when you click or scroll.

Think of a restaurant:

- **Frontend** is like the dining area ‚Äî the tables, menu, lights, and music ‚Äî everything the customer sees.
- **Backend** is like the kitchen ‚Äî where the real cooking (data processing) happens behind the scenes.

Frontend developers use:

- **HTML** ‚Äì for structure (like building blocks e.g: text, images, buttons),
- **CSS** ‚Äì for style (colors, layout, fonts),
- **JavaScript** ‚Äì for behavior (like making a button do something when clicked, animations, dynamic updates).

Modern frontend development also uses frameworks like **React, Vue, or Angular** to build complex applications efficiently.
