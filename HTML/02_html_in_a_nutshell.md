### **HTML in a Nutshell (Simple Terms)**

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of web pages. It’s a **markup language** used to **structure** content on the web. Think of it like a blueprint that tells a browser how to display text, images, links, buttons, and other elements.

💡 **Key Concept:** HTML is NOT a programming language—it just defines the **structure** of a webpage.

### **Basic HTML Structure**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a simple paragraph.</p>
    <a href="https://example.com">Click me</a>
  </body>
</html>
```

- `<html>`: The root element of a webpage.
- `<head>`: Contains metadata (title, styles, scripts).
- `<title>`: Defines the webpage’s title (shown on browser tabs).
- `<body>`: Holds visible content like text, images, and links.
- `<h1>`: A heading.
- `<p>`: A paragraph.
- `<a>`: A hyperlink.

🔥 **TL;DR**: HTML structures the web. It tells browsers **what content to display** (but not how it looks—that’s done with CSS). Every webpage uses HTML, from Google to your favorite blogs! 🚀
