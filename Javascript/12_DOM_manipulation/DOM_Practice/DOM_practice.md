## üìò **Theoretical Questions**
Focus: Explanation, comparison, and definitions

1. **Explain the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const` in variable declarations.**

2. **Differentiate between primitive and non-primitive data types in JavaScript, giving examples.**

3. **What is the purpose of the `typeof` operator? Provide three different examples and their outputs.**

4. **Describe what the Document Object Model (DOM) is in your own words. Why is it important in web development?**

5. **How do conditionals like `if-else` improve decision-making in JavaScript code? Provide an example involving a user's age.**

## üõ†Ô∏è **Practical Exercises**
Focus: Implementation and hands-on coding

### üü† Beginner DOM Practice
1. **Create a simple HTML file with a button. Write JavaScript that changes the button text to "Clicked!" when the button is clicked.**

2. **Write a script that takes input from a text field and displays it in a paragraph when a "Submit" button is clicked.**

3. **Create an array of 5 colors. On clicking a button, change the background color of the page to a random color from the array.**

### üîµ Intermediate DOM Practice (with integration)
4. **Design a basic calculator with buttons for add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Take two number inputs and display the result using DOM methods.**

5. **Build a mini student list manager:**
   - Input: Student name
   - Button: Add to list
   - Output: Display in a list using `ul` and `li`
   - Bonus: Show total number of students using `length`

6. **Use object methods to dynamically update DOM content:**
   ```javascript
   const user = {
     name: "Ada",
     age: 22,
     greet: function() {
       return `Hello, I am ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`;
     }
   };
   ```
   - Display the `greet()` message in an HTML paragraph on page load.

### üî¥ Advanced Practical Challenge
7. **Build a simple to-do list app with the following:**
   - Input field to add task
   - Button to add
   - Display list of tasks
   - Button next to each task to "Remove"
   - Use array methods (`push`, `splice`) and DOM manipulation

8. **Create a random quote generator:**
   - Store 5 quotes in an array of objects (`{ quote, author }`)
   - On button click, show a random quote and author on screen
