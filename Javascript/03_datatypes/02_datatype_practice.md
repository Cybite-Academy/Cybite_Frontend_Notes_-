# Datatypes Practice

Here are some assignment questions on JavaScript data types using `console.log`. The questions cover strings, numbers, `typeof`, booleans, variables (`let`, `const`, and automatic assignment), and variable naming rules.

### **JavaScript Data Types Assignment**

### **Section 1: Practical Questions**

Use `console.log` to print the answers in each question.

1. Declare a variable `message` and assign it the string `"Hello, JavaScript!"`. Print its value.
2. Create a variable `age` and assign it the number `25`. Print its value.
3. Declare a variable `isStudent` and set it to `true`. Print its value.
4. Use `typeof` to check the data type of `message`, `age`, and `isStudent`. Print the results.
5. Declare a variable without using `let` or `const`, assign it a value of `10`, and print it.
6. Use `let` to declare a variable `price`, assign it `199.99`, and print its value.
7. Declare a constant `PI` with the value `3.14159` and print it.
8. Try changing the value of `PI` and observe what happens (add a comment explaining the error).
9. Create a variable `firstName`, assign your name to it, then print `"My name is "` followed by the value of `firstName`.
10. Declare a boolean variable `isRaining`, set it to `false`, and print `"Is it raining? "` followed by its value.
